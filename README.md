## DESCRIPTION

This is a SQL and Javascript database I've written to help a company view and update its employee roster and roles. It currently allows for viewing the roles, departments, and employees, but will soon also allow the user to update all of these accordingly.

## CREDITS

This program was written by me, Kyle Oros. I received Javascript assistance from an AskBCS team member, as well as my instructor.
